# hello-world
A short description
Hello my name is Oliver and I am a thirteen year old programmer in ninth grade. I have learnt HTML and CSS although the absence of praticing them have made my knowledge fade substantially. This has lead to the reason for myself joining GitHub. I was going to create a website mainly because I had a great idea of a website and I have also sort of done it for an assignment for school. When I was signing up for the website hoster, it told me that I could sign up with GitHub which has led me to taking the tutorial.
